/*
The goal of this exercise is to program a Guess My Number game. When itâ€™s finished, it should work like this: I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100 (including both). Can you guess what it is? 
Type a number: 45 // get input
Your guess is: 45 
The number I was thinking of is: 14 
You were off by: 31   

Hint: You need this Java Class, Random
import java.util.Random;

This is JavaScript, but exactly how the Java program should run:
