# Java-AP-CS-A

This repository contains some of the code I have introduced in class. These are solutions as well as starter code for some of the exercises taught in class. 

There are several ways you can work with the code:

You can create a copy of this repository on GitHub by clicking the "Fork" button. If you don't already have a GitHub account, you'll need to create one. After forking, you'll have your own repository on GitHub that you can use to keep track of code you write. Then you can "clone" the repository, which downloads a copy of the files to your computer.

Alternatively, you could clone the original repository without forking. If you choose this option, you don't need a GitHub account, but you won't be able to save your changes on GitHub.

If you don't want to use Git at all, you can download the code in a ZIP archive using the "Clone or download" button
